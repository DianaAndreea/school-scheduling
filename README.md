#About the project
#The project was about developing a software for school scheduling.
#The user was the administrator of the department. The application will help the administrator arrange courses for each year, by #semester. Also, the administrator, could add, delete, modify and view teachers, contents, groups and subgroups, years and fields and #print the final school schedule.

#This was a team project, where I was the team-leader. As a team leader, I had to give to all members tasks and manage the project. Also, #because it was a big project for 5 people in 2 months, I created the graphic interface and help the rest of the team on different tasks.

#The project contains 2 user interfaces: 1 for the scheduler and 1 for the administrator.
#Clicking on Orar ( means scheduler ), you will discover a table. To add courses in the table, you must select first from dropdowns the #year, group, subgroup and the week ( this scheduler aplies only for the Romanian universities ). After selecting everything, you can #double click on a cell and it will open a new window to setup the course ( the teacher, which kind of module it is: 2 hours, 3 hours #or #more, the hall available and so on). All these data are generated automated from the database.
#How I said, the administrator can add through the second button Administrator, different kinds of data. He can update some list of #teachers, subjects, halls and to divide years by groups and subgroups.
